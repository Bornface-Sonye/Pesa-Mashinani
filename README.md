# READ ME: PESA MASHINANI

## ABSTRACT
Pesa Mashinani is a web-based application aimed at connecting money lenders and borrowers, improving financial security, and minimizing loan defaults. The system, developed using the Django framework, will streamline the process of loan applications, disbursements, and repayments. By incorporating machine learning algorithms and integrating external data from banks, the application will provide a more efficient and secure lending platform.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Pesa Mashinani aims to revolutionize the financial lending landscape by creating a secure and efficient platform for money lenders and borrowers. The application will facilitate seamless interactions between banks, youth and women groups, and individual borrowers while ensuring robust loan security measures.

## 2. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Current money lending platforms face significant challenges, including manual loan approval processes, potential corruption, and a lack of integration with external data sources. These issues lead to loan defaults, inefficiencies, and limited productivity among borrowers.

### 2.3 The Proposed Idea
Pesa Mashinani will address these challenges by automating loan approval processes, integrating external data for defaulter filtering, and utilizing machine learning to assess borrowers' financial traits. The platform will require borrowers to belong to groups with guarantors, ensuring higher loan security and reducing defaults.

## 3. OBJECTIVES

### 3.1 General Objective
To develop a web-based application that connects money lenders and borrowers, enhancing financial security and efficiency in the loan process.

### 3.2 Specific Objectives
1. To automate the loan application, approval, and disbursement processes.
2. To integrate external data sources for enhanced borrower assessment.
3. To utilize machine learning algorithms to propose loans based on financial performance.
4. To provide a secure platform that minimizes loan defaults and improves lender confidence.

## 4. PROBLEM JUSTIFICATION

### 4.1 Rationale of Automating the Current System
Automating the current system will reduce paperwork, eliminate manual errors, and speed up loan processing times. By incorporating machine learning and external data integration, Pesa Mashinani will provide a more accurate and secure lending environment.

## 5. LITERATURE

### 5.1 The Current System
Current money lending platforms involve manual processes, lack integration with external data, and do not leverage modern technologies like machine learning. These limitations lead to inefficiencies and increased loan default rates.

### 5.2 Challenges and Limitations of the Current System
- Manual loan approval processes prone to errors and corruption.
- Lack of integration with defaulters' lists and other external data.
- Inability to assess borrowers' financial traits using modern technologies.
- No system to tie borrowers to groups, reducing accountability and increasing default rates.

### 5.3 Conceptual Design

#### 5.3.1 User Interface
The user interface will be intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate the platform, apply for loans, and manage their financial transactions.

#### 5.3.2 Report Generation
The system will generate detailed reports on loan applications, approvals, disbursements, repayments, and defaulters, providing valuable insights to lenders and administrators.

#### 5.3.3 Data Management
Efficient data management will ensure secure storage, retrieval, and processing of user information, loan details, and financial transactions.

## 6. METHODOLOGY
